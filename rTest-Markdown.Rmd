## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Flight Time Summary, warning=FALSE}
Flight_Time_Accuracy <- read_excel("Flight_Time_Accuracy.xlsx")
summary(Flight_Time_Accuracy)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Pilot Summary, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Flight_Time_Pilot_Summary <- Flight_Time_Accuracy %>% 
  select(PIC, FlightLogTime, QuotedToActual, EstimatedToActual) %>%
  group_by(PIC) %>%
  summarize(FlightLogTime = sum(FlightLogTime), QuotedToActual = mean(QuotedToActual, na.rm = T), EstimatedToActual = mean(EstimatedToActual, na.rm = T)) %>%
  mutate(FlightLogTime = reorder(FlightLogTime, PIC)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(PIC, FlightLogTime)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip()
Flight_Time_Pilot_Summary
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
